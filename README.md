# About

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, and is a project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program. All files, except for feedreader.js file, were already created by Udacity. My role was to create Jasmine tests within the feedreader.js file to make sure the application is working correctly.


## How to open 

Open the index.html file in your browser to view the application.

## To view/edit Jasmine tests

Open the feedreader.js file (jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) in order to view and/or edit the tests.
